# Secret Music EE in Survival maps
I noticed that while playing a shit ton of Survival maps that there is a lack of the secret music teddy bears in those maps.
So I decided to take liberty in adding it myself.

Screenshots of the Teddy Bear Locations are in this Wiki page: https://github.com/techboy04/MusicEESurvival-T6/wiki/Teddy-Bear-Locations

## Installation
Download secretsongsurvival.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using  secretsongsurvival_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
